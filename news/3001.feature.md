PDM is now published with optional pinned dependencies using the pdm plugin [pdm-build-locked](https://pdm-build-locked.readthedocs.io/).

To install pdm with its dependencies pinned to the versions it was tested with, run:

```bash

    pipx install pdm[locked]
```

To install optional dependency group copier:

```bash

    pipx install pdm[locked,copier-locked]
```

This feature is entirely optional. Installing pdm without the extra will work the same way as before this change.
