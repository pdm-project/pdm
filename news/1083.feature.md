*BREAKING*: Editable dependencies in the `[project]` table is not allowed, according to PEP 621. They are however still allowed in the `[tool.pdm.dev-dependencies]` table. PDM will emit a warning when it finds editable dependencies in the `[project]` table, or will abort when you try to add them into the `[project]` table via CLI.
