- Lazily load the candidates returned by `find_matches()` to speed up the resolution. [#1098](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1098)

- Improve the lock speed by parallelizing the hash fetching. [#1154](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1154)

- Update the format converters to support the new `[tool.pdm.build]` table. [#1157](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1157)
- Scripts are now available as root command if they don't conflict with any builtin or plugin-contributed command. [#1159](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1159)
- Add a `post_use` hook triggered after successfully switching Python version. [#1163](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1163)
- Add project configuration `respect-source-order` under `[tool.pdm.resolution]` to respect the source order in the `pyproject.toml` file. Packages will be returned by source earlier in the order or later ones if not found. [#593](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/593)
